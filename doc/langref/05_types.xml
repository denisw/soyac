  <title>Types</title>

  <para>
  Soya is a strongly-typed programming language, that is, every expression and
  variable has a type known at compile time. There are two kinds of types in
  Soya: value types and reference types.

    <title>Value Types</title>

    <para>
    A value type is an simple type, enumeration type or struct type.

    <para>
    Contrary to a reference type value, which is a reference to an object (),
    a value of a value type is the type instance itself. Thus, multiple
    value type variables with the same value are independent from each
    other as every variable has it's own copy of that value.

      <title>Simple Types</title>

      <para>
      The simple types are predefined by the Soya programming language. They
      are identified through reserved keywords. Simple types are integral types,
      floating point types, and the <type>bool</type> type.

        <para>
        A value of a pointer type is a reference to an value of a specific type,
        which is said to be the underlying type of the pointer type. Pointers
        enable the creation of references to instances of value types.

      <para>
      A class type is a user-defined reference type for which fields, methods,
      properties, instance constructors, destructors, static constructors,
      and nested types may be declared. Using inheritance, classes can be
      defined to be specialize or extend an existing class type.

      <title>Interface Types</title>

      <para>
      An interface type is a set of requirements that a class type must fulfill
      in order to implement the interface. Like class types (), interface types
      support inheritance, meaning that an interface type   can be defined to be
      an extension of one or more other interface types.
