  <title>Grammars</title>

  <para>
  The structure of a Soya module () is defined by two context-free grammars.
  The <firstterm>lexical grammar</firstterm> defines how a sequence of
  characters is to be translated into a sequence of tokens. The <firstterm>
  syntactic grammar</firstterm> specifies how these tokens are then translated
  into a valid Soya module.
  </para>

  <para>
  Both grammars are specified using the Extended BNF metalanguage (ISO/IEC
  14977). The terms "production", "terminal symbol", and "non-terminal symbol"
  are used in this specification as defined in the EBNF standard.

    <title>Lexical Grammar</title>

    <para>
    The lexical grammar of Soya is presented in (3). It's terminal symbols are
    the characters of the Unicode character set. The productions of the lexical
    grammar specify how these characters are translated into a sequence of
    input elements, consisting of tokens (), white space () and comments ().
    </para>

    <para>
    Every Soya module must conform with the input production of the lexical
    grammar ().

    <title>Syntactic Grammar</title>

    <para>
    The syntactical grammar of Soya is presented in chapters 4 through ?.
    It's terminal symbols are the tokens defined by the lexical grammar.
    The productions of the grammar specify how these tokens are translated
    to a valid Soya module. 
    </para>

    <para>
    Every Soya module must conform with the module production of the syntactic
    grammar ().
